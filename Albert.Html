            <h2 class="descriptionHeader">With the plastic waste crisis in mind, I developed new methods for processing
                plastic shopping bags into
                durable materials for accessories.</h2>
            <p class="descriptionParagraph">After a couple trips to the grocery store Albert Heijn, I began to
                accumulate a mass amount of plastic
                bags that I could not reasonably use. The extras would be destined for the landfill, so I researched
                ways to reuse plastics for crafting and textile use. By using a heat press to combining multiple sheets
                of plastic, I was able to fabricate and use these leather like materials to develop a sword sheath for
                fencers.</p>

                        understand

                        heat
                        (if multiple layers are welded together) and sewing.</p>
